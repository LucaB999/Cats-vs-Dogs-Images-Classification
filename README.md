Project aimed to develop a CNN for classifying images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Several CNN architectures were tested to determine which one performed the best on the input data. The selected model was then evaluated using cross-validation (CV) to compute the risk estimate. The best model achieved an accuracy of 90%.
